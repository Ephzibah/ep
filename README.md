This is the "Iris" dataset. Originally published at [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris), this small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations (for example, [Scatter Plot](http://bl.ocks.org/curran/9e04ccfebeb84bcdc76c)).
